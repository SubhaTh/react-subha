    <h1>Hello, welcome to my React articles!</h1>
    <p>
        Welcome to my blog! React is a JavaScript library 
that you can use to create user interfaces. 
It was created at Facebook and open-sourced 
in March of 2013. 
</p>
    <p>
    Since then, React has expanded beyond the web 
with React Native, a tool that allows you 
to create native mobile applications using React. 
One of the best resources that you have at your disposal 
when learning React is the React Docs. 
</p>
    <p>
    These are updated on a really regular basis 
and are very well-written. 
React is an increasingly popular library 
with tens of thousands of stars on GitHub 
and use in production by huge companies 
like Twitter, Netflix, and Microsoft. 
But the point of using React 
is not just because it's popular, 
but because it's fun to use 
and because its component architecture 
makes it faster and easier to build amazing products 
for the web and even for native platforms.
